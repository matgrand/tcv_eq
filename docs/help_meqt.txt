                g: basis functions
                D: plasma domain (>1 for e.g. doublets)
                W: wall gaps, nFW: number of flux values being tracked

    NB: In the code the q and Q suffixes can be used to designate 2D (rho,theta) quantities.
        For clarity they are broken down here into q/Q for rho and o for theta.
